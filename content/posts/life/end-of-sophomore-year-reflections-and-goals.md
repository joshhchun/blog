As of May 5th, 2022, I have officially finished my Sophomore academic year at Notre Dame and am now a rising Junior. I would do anything to have time _slow down_ right now, but the inevitable march of time trudges on. 

When I look back on my Sophomore year, it was **hard**. But it was also rewarding. Academically, I think this year has definitely been the most challenging — **many** late nights spent in the CS Lounge (_and B19 Laboratory, but we don't talk about B19_). I took 

* Systems Programming
* Data Structures
* Logic Design and Sequential Circuits 
* Linear Algebra & Differential Equations
* The Climate Crisis

Overall, I ended up doing pretty well in my classes (landed on the Dean's list for the 4th consecutive semester), but the overall workload was **a lot**. I think having to worry about internships around winter break also added stress, but it all ended up working out.
