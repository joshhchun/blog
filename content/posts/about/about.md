## Academia

I am currently a Glenna R. Joyce Scholar and rising Junior at the [University of Notre Dame](https://nd.edu). I originally came to Notre Dame as a Chemical Engineer on the pre-med track, but I quickly found my love for coding.

```C
fprintf(stdout, "here1\n");
...
fprintf(stdout, "here2\n");
...
fprintf(stdout, "ajsdnjwenjfnjewf\n");
```

`> Segmentation fault (core dumped)`

From the moment I started coding (albeit my first language was [MATLAB](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-MATLAB-so-bad)), I knew this is what I wanted to do with my life. The ability to create _something_ from _nothing_ (minus the billions of transistors) fascinated me.
Currently I'm interested in:

> -   Web development
> -   Machine Learning (CNN & RNN)
> -   Socket Programming
> -   Unix

I know I have so much more to learn so my tech blogs are really just to serve as a timeline of all the knowledge I will accumulate over the years.

## Work

### `ZEmployed`
In the summer after my Freshman year, I was a back-end developer for a start-up called **ZEmployed**, which was created at Notre Dame. I'm thankful for the experience because it gave me initial exposure to things like [Django Web Framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). This startup eventually got funded $50,000 while I was working there.

### `Krugle`
My second job was at a company called **[Krugle](https://krugle.com/)**, a company based in Cupertino, California. My role at the company was a DevOps Engineer, and I worked there during the Fall semester of my Sophomore year. I'm thankful for my time at Krugle, because it was the first time that I worked at a large-scale company. Developing communication skills, working with the agile methodology, and seeing code deployed at scale was very valuable.

### `MITRE`
This summer, I will be working at **[MITRE](https://www.mitre.org/)** as a Software Engineer Intern in the Cyber Division at their Bedford, Massachusetts office. I don't know too many details on which specific team/project I will be working on yet, but I am beyond excited for the opportunity.

## Personal

I was born in [Columbus, Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbus,_Ohio), and I have lived there for all my life (excluding college). Coming to college, I have realized that Ohio is seen as a very undesirable location to live. Never really understood that though... we have corn! :corn:&nbsp;&nbsp;I have **loved** my time in Ohio, and I truly would not trade it for anything in the world. (_okay maybe bring in Hawaii or Spain and we can start talking_).

My mother and father are both from [South Korea (Seoul)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seoul), and my
brother was born there as well. He is currently 23..24..25 years old? yeah, he's pretty old now. He just recently got married and is currently attending [UPenn Dental School](https://www.dental.upenn.edu/). I have been so blessed to grow up with such a loving family, and they have truly made me who I am today.
